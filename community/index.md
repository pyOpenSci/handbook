# Community Handbook

pyOpenSci has built a vibrant open science community of practice. This
community:

1. helps scientists develop the open science skills needed to make their workflows more open and collaborative.
2. runs a Python software peer review process that reviews scientific software.
3. partners and leverage the work of other communities so we can learn and move forward together.

In this section of the handbook, we describe the platforms, processes and
approaches that we use to engage with both scientists and the broader
scientific Python community.
