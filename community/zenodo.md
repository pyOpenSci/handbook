:::{admonition} How to cite pyOpenSci
:class: tip

pyOpenSci doesn't yet have an organization-level citation, but all of our resources and GitHub repositories are citable. To find a citation for a specific pyOpenSci resource, go to the repository in our GitHub organization and look at the top of the README.md file.
:::

Zenodo is a general-purpose research repository where anyone can publish outputs and receive a citable DOI (digital object identifier).

pyOpenSci uses Zenodo to create citable entries for:

* GitHub software repositories
* Presentations by pyOpenSci staff and community members
* Online educational resources, like our [Packaging guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/)

For GitHub repositories, pyOpenSci includes a Zenodo citation badge at the top of the README file, linking directly to the citation page. pyOpenSci also encourages all its software packages to use Zenodo to create a DOI for their Python packages.

When major updates are made to resources, such as the Packaging guide, pyOpenSci creates a new release. Zenodo then generates an updated DOI specific to that release, allowing users to cite the latest version.

## pyOpenSci Zenodo Community

pyOpenSci maintains a [community group](https://zenodo.org/communities/pyopensci?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest) on Zenodo where both staff and community members can share content related to pyOpenSci, including presentations, blog posts, open education resources, software, and other materials. This allows contributors to receive a citable DOI while retaining ownership of their submissions.

The pyOpenSci Zenodo community is moderated by pyOpenSci staff, who review and approve all suggested additions to ensure relevance and quality.
