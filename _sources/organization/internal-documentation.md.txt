### Organization Google Drive structure

All pyOpenSci staff members should work on and store pyOpenSci-related documents in the **pyos-shared** Google Shared Drive. Storing documents in the **pyos-shared** drive ensures that all pyOpenSci employees can access, edit, and use these documents.

Storing these documents in the shared drive also supports program task redundancy, as the document's owner is the organization in that drive rather than an individual user. Storing documents in a shared drive owned by the organization helps pyOpenSci staff jump in and help another staff person in the event of a needed but unplanned absence (e.g., a medical emergency or an unexpected family issue).

Employees can save personal documents such as 1-on-1 agendas and notes, personal notes, and other information that do not need to be shared at the organizational level in their pyOpenSci individual drive and share them with other team members as needed.
