# The pyOpenSci brand

The pyOpenSci brand is playful and curious. It integrates a calm, gender-neutral color palette with illustrations and abstract primary shapes that are soft, round, and flowing.
All of the elements that support our brand can be found in our Canva organization.

## Logos, colors, and fonts

pyOpenSci stores its logos, brand colors, and font information in [Canva](pyos-canva). However, we also store some of our logos and brand assets in a [publicly-shared Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m4cG3JLonP0mQ8y3pBaULMulpja-As0l?usp=drive_link) for community members to use as needed.

### pyOpenSci logos

The pyOpenSci logo combines the idea of openness with growth using an open flower petal
with lines and spokes that represent "connection".

pyOpenSci uses three variations on a floral logo:
* pyOpenSci written horizontally, with a flower "opening" over the "O" in pyOpenSci
* a four- or five-petaled flower with pyOpenSci abbreviated as pyOS
* a five-petaled flower icon

From left to right, the logos include a dark purple logo with three petals above the word pyOpenSci. The 'O' in pyOpenSci is the center of the flower. The second image from the left is a four-petaled flower, with the text py and then an S in the shape of a snake inside an O. The text comes in from the left. The flower petals surround the O. The next image is identical to the second from the left but in a lighter purple shade. The final image is the pyOpenSci flower with five petals and an open center. This logo is in light purple.

### pyOpenSci fonts

pyOpenSci uses [Itim](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) as its fonts. Itim is most commonly used as a header, while Poppins is used for body text. Poppins is available in multiple weights, and at this time pyOpenSci uses the most appropriate weight for accessibility and readability, which varies by use case.
