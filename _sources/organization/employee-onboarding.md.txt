# New Hire Onboarding

The following needs to happen when a new team member joins pyOpenSci’s staff as core staff.

## Community Initiatives Onboarding

The new hire needs to meet with Community Initiatives HR and complete any training, fill out any paperwork that is required by Community Initiatives.

## pyOpenSci onboarding process

* **Create Employee Google Workspace Account:** An email should be created with the new hire's <name@pyopensci.org> should be created using the Google Workspace admin console.
* **Add staff to shared Google Drives:** Within our workspace, the new hire should be added to: `pyos-shared`.

* **Add the employee to email groups as needed**
  * [admin@pyopensci.org](mailto:admin@pyopensci.org): used for administration tasks such as calls for hiring.
  * [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org): used for general social media work.

### Provide permission to access

* **Our pyOpenSci GitHub organization** In some cases the new hire may already have a GitHub account. So on the first day, ask what account they prefer to use for pyOpenSci work. You can filter notifications by organization repo and email so it could be that some wish to use their personal profile so activity profiles are concentrated. The email can be modified easily on an account.
* **Add to [Asana](https://asana.com/)** - added to the pyOpenSci Operations team on Asana: we have a paid plan for Asana and it’s linked to GitHub issues. This is a great way to keep track of tasks (see more below on using Asana and tracking tasks).
* **Invite to Slack:** Slack is our primary mode of communication day to day. Learn more about [how we use Slack](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/community/slack.html).
* **Social media and content platform access as needed**
  * Login credentials for LinkedIn, Mastodon, and BlueSky
  * Added to YouTube channel at appropriate level

### Announcing the new hire to the community

* **Announce in Slack:** New staff will be introduced in the `#pyos-updates` slack channel and asked to share a bit about themselves.
* **Add to website:** Update the data file with the new hire's name and information and add them as "staff". This will update them on the “Our pyOpenSci” community page.
* **Introductory blog post:** New hires write brief blog posts introducing themselves to the community. The post can include topics such as: their work background, hobbies, why they joined pyOS, and what they’ll be doing with pyOS.
* **Social media:** Post the announcement of the hire on social channels.

## Staff check-ins

When new members join the pyOpenSci team, they may need more up-front meeting time to adjust to the organization and our work environment. As such, when an employee starts, a standard weekly check-in time will be scheduled with their manager to discuss current tasks and how things are going.

These meetings are a good time to ask for help or guidance, discuss challenges, and suggest ways to improve our workflows. The meeting cadence can be flexible, accommodating each employee's needs. We will move to that if we find that a bi-weekly meeting might be more productive. If weekly meetings continue to be useful, then we will stick to that schedule.
