# How we work

pyOpenSci uses various platforms to work collaboratively internally and with the broader community, including:

* GitHub and
* Google Drive

Wherever possible, we work using open, collaborative tools such as GitHub and Google Drive.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform pyOpenSci uses for collaborative work on software, technical resources, and educational materials. It helps our community of developers, scientists, and educators co-develop community resources while also supporting collaborative workflows and version control. GitHub supports tracking changes through a platform called **Git**. This makes it easy for multiple people to contribute, review, and improve materials such as software packages, technical documentation, and lessons. GitHub also supports transparent discussions and issue tracking, fostering community collaboration and feedback. For pyOpenSci, GitHub is a central hub where contributions are organized and accessible, helping ensure quality and inclusivity in our open science resources.

pyOpenSci uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) to manage external content development for our:

* Website
* online lessons
* peer review processes
* packaging content development

pyOpenSci staff use the tool in a similar way, tracking bugs and updates to content using GitHub issues, tracking event participation such as sprints through project boards and to support our online software peer review process.

GitHub is public-facing to our entire community.

To learn more about GitHub processes at pyOpenSci, please refer to the [GitHub processes](github-intro) handbook page.

(google-drive)=
### Google Drive

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), part of the pyOpenSci Google Workspace, is used to store all internal pyOpenSci documents, spreadsheets, slides, photos, and graphics essential for our operations. Each pyOpenSci staff member has a personal, work-related Google Drive account for individual documents, while shared resources are stored in designated folders on the organizational shared drive.

Our Google Drive contains important materials, including:
- Branding guidelines
- Event planning documents
- Lesson development drafts and plans
- Presentation slides for talks
- And more

Google Workspace, which includes both Google Drive and email accounts, supports pyOpenSci’s daily operations and implements two-factor authentication for added security.

### Organization Google Drive structure

All pyOpenSci staff members should work on and store pyOpenSci-related documents in the **pyos-shared** Google Shared Drive. Storing documents in the **pyos-shared** drive ensures that all pyOpenSci employees can access, edit, and use these documents.

Storing these documents in the shared drive also supports program task redundancy, as the document's owner is the organization in that drive rather than an individual user. Storing documents in a shared drive owned by the organization helps pyOpenSci staff jump in and help another staff person in the event of a needed but unplanned absence (e.g., a medical emergency or an unexpected family issue).

Employees can save personal documents such as 1-on-1 agendas and notes, personal notes, and other information that do not need to be shared at the organizational level in their pyOpenSci individual drive and share them with other team members as needed.

### Slack

pyOpenSci uses Slack to communicate both as paid staff and within our community organization. Slack is a valuable tool for asynchronous, synchronous, and remote communication.

When communicating internally, Slack is used for informal conversations, notifying other staff members of changes to scheduling or other non-task-related conversations. Conversations related to projects and tasks should be held in the appropriate Asana issue or project.

Read more about how the community uses Slack on the [Slack](pyos-slack) handbook page.

:::{important}
if a conversation comes up about something in Slack where it’s clear we need better / additional documentation, turn that conversation into an issue (sometimes the community member involved might volunteer to do this as well). That way, we can keep track of things that need to be updated, fixed, etc., as a Slack conversation's output. If we determine that the issue is high priority or time-sensitive, then we may also turn it into a linked Asana task and assign it to someone on the core team.

### Asana

[Asana](https://asana.com/) is an internal tool we use as pyOpenSci staff for general task management. Within Asana, the general workflow is that we can assign each other tasks that need to be accomplished along with task deadlines. In our check-in, we can review tasks, update deadlines as needed, and discuss future efforts. Asana can also be used to build road maps for projects.

Asana is also connected to GitHub, which allows us to track open issues and pull requests as needed.


### Shared calendars & time tracking

* **[Calendly](https://calendly.com/):** we have a subscription to Calendly that can be used to schedule meetings. If the new hire wishes to use Calendly, then we can purchase another license.
* **Google Calendar:** We use Google Calendar to keep track of schedules.
    * All employees should share Google calendars with the team--it’s helpful for us all to know where and when we are working.
    * If you have confidential appointments such as medical appointments please make them private so the team knows you are unavailable at that time. Work-related appointments should be public to the pyOpenSci team, unless they are confidential in nature.
* **[Don't interrupt](https://dontinterrupt.app/)**: Don’t interrupt is setup in Slack. Use this tool to link your calendar to Slack, so it’s easy to tell when you are online and available vs. offline / on vacation, etc. This is invaluable, particularly when working asynchronously.

### Bitwarden

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a password manager and passkey service used by pyOpenSci at both individual and organizational levels.

- **For Individuals**: Team members are encouraged to use Bitwarden to securely store passwords related to their pyOpenSci work, including access to Google Workspaces services like Drive and Gmail and applications like Slack and Canva.

- **For the Organization**: Bitwarden manages shared login access to accounts where only one organizational account is needed, such as Eventbrite and Buffer. Authorized team members can access these shared credentials as necessary.
