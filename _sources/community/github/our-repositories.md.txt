# pyOpenSci GitHub repositories


:::{todo}
Add repositories from the pyOpenSci organization.
:::

pyOpenSci manages multiple GitHub repositories to support various community
activities. Below is a description of each repository.

### [Software-review repository](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/)

The software-review repository is where community package submissions are
peer-reviewed. All submissions are made through GitHub Issues. [Learn more
about our peer review process here.](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/)

:::{important}
Important: If a pyOpenSci core member identifies an issue with the review
submission template, consult both the editorial team and core team before
making any changes. This template's data are processed by a Python workflow,
and even small modifications could disrupt the language processing.

## Software-peer-review guidebook repository

This repository hosts our [software peer review
guidebook](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/), which documents
the processes and guidelines for authors, editors, the Editor in Chief, and the
peer review triage team as they manage our open peer review process. It also
details our peer review policies, partnerships, and the templates used in the
review process.

## Python-package-guide repository

The [python-package-guide
repository](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/) contains our
community-developed guidelines and tutorials on Python packaging. These
resources are beginner-friendly and reflect Python packaging best practices.

## [pyosMeta repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyosMeta)

The pyosMeta repository contains a Python package published on PyPI that we use
to track our package review and contributor data. This data is used in a GitHub
action to update our website.

:::{todo}
Add more information about the contributor data workflow ...

## [pyopensci.github.io repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyopensci.github.io)

This repository contains code and content that builds and publishes our
pyOpenSci website. The website, [pyOpenSci](https://www.pyopensci.org/), is
hosted on GitHub and uses the [Jekyll Minimal
Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. The Python
packages page, contributor page, and peer review team page are all updated
automatically using a GitHub action workflow that is supported by the pyosMeta
Python package discussed above. The workflow runs every other week but can be
triggered manually as a **workflow dispatch**.

### Critical CI workflows in this repository

The [contributor workflow
action](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyopensci.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-contribs-reviews.yml)
is a custom GitHub action that is used to update the following website pages:

* contributor page
* package listing page
* editorial, advisory council, and executive council listing

It runs as a cron job every other week but also can be run manually as a
workflow dispatch. If you need to update our package listing or contributor
list on the fly, please run this action.

The action will:

1. Parse through all of our accepted pyOpenSci packages.
2. Collect package names, authors, reviewers, and editors.
3. Collect metadata for the package authors, reviewers, and editors using the
   GitHub (REST) API.
4. Create 2 output YAML files discussed below.

The YAML output files are then used to populate content on the website.

### Metadata stored in this repository

1. **Packages.yml**: Updates the [Python Packages
   page](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html) by parsing reviews
   from software-review repository issues.
2. **Contributors.yml**: Updates the [Our Community
   page](https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/index.html) by parsing data
   from all organization repositories.

:::{todo}
Update the website contributors guide with general CI and specific Jekyll
information.

## [pyOpenSci Sphinx theme](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyos-sphinx-theme)

**Platform:** Sphinx book template that builds on top of the pydata_sphinx_theme

All of our pyOpenSci Sphinx books (handbook, packaging guide, software review
guide) have been customized to match our pyOpenSci branding. This repo contains
the start of a Sphinx theme that will incorporate all of our branding, so we do
not have to manually apply the branding and update it individually in each repo.
Instead, we can update branding in the theme, and it will be applied across all
of our repositories that use the theme.

Creating a theme was inspired by the
[2i2c Sphinx theme](https://sphinx-2i2c-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## [Handbook repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/handbook)

**Platform:** Sphinx book running the `pydata_sphinx_theme`

This is where we store our organization governance, code of conduct, and
processes around how we operate as an organization.

## [pyosPackage repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyosPackage)

The pyosPackage repo contains an example pure-Python package that complements
our package guide & tutorials. We will build this package example out over time
for folks that just want to see a working package without creating one
themselves.
