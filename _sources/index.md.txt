## Why pyOpenSci?

pyOpenSci promotes open and reproducible research through [peer review of
scientific Python packages](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html). We also build technical capacity by providing a
curated repository of high-quality packages and enabling scientists to write
and share their own software. We hope to foster a greater sense of community
among scientific Python users to help each other become better
programmers and researchers.
