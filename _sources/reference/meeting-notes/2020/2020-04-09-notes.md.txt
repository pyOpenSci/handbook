# pyOpenSci Meeting Notes - 9 April 2020


## Attendees

* Leah Wasser, Earth Lab, CU Boulder
* Max Joseph, Earth Lab/North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center, CU Boulder
* Philip Meier, inIT- Institute Industrial IT, TH-OWL (Germany)
* Jenny Palomino, Earth Lab/North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center, CU Boulder
* David Nicholson
* moritz Lurig
* Daniel Chen, Virginia Tech

## Discussion Points

* Phenopype -- is more on the computer vision end of things so it's likely in scope for pyopensci. lets request a submission!
    * looking for an editor for this submission
* Packages that have more advanced algorithms where reviewers might be more limited,
* We should decvelop a relationship with methods in ecology and evaluations

* Pystiche -- deep learning, goal of reproducing papers in the literature. is likely going to submit to joss regardless...
    * to review this -- we'd want to ensure reviewers could assess the "correctness"
    * Maybe one reviewer with domain depth in neural style transfer to focus on the correctness of the implementation, and another reviewer with a background in deep learning with pytorch and some python library dev. experience that would evaluate the docs, tests, etc.



## Testing & Pyopensci

obspy -- we should make a decision

Provide a few options for him to fix this issue:
* Are there options to pull out pieces of it for pyOpenSci vs io stuff that might be more difficult to get passing tests?
* Are there things we could do to support them in fixing the test like mocking servers...
*
