## Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->
1. softare review sync
 + devicely
   + ask on twitter about reviewers
   + OW: could act as reviewer, worked on related tool
 + pymedphys
   + LW: pymedphys -- actually a set of tools -  similar to astropy
 + some issues we should close  - close all of the old presumbissions
2. editorial board
  +  Lets start with Ivan, David and Leah
  +  We might consider domain "buckets"
  + ROpenSci + JOSS like model
  + who do we want, how long do they serve
  + we have onboarded them

## Action Items
- LW: close older issues w/invitation to submit
- LW: will get back to simon about PyMedPhys
- DN: add suggestion to editor guide to update initial comment w/reviewers etc. so it's right at top of issue
- DN: post on twitter asking for reviewrs for devicely
- DN: figure out if there's overlap for phylup
- DN: follow up w/LW + IO about mentored sprints at SciPy

## SciPy Mentored Sprints (David) - Tania Allard
* they are doing these springs at pycon
  * https://mentored-sprints.netlify.app/
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUHyP8ki_Q
* could we use pyopensci maintainers to participate in the mentored sprints?
    * Have them bring friends who can contribute to the sprints?
    * maintainers would need to identify things to fix
    * Then they would come to the sprint
    * Do they have to register for scipy?
    * sprints are run in discord
    * git help desk
    * maintainers volunteer time to
        * find issues ahead of time
        * work with people  who want to submit PRs
        * ask them to do things that aren't code contributions like run through a tutorial and raise issues, etc.
    * Open science labs - they do hae training materials already in (spanish?)


Challenges with mentored sprints
*  getting envt setup
*  knowing what issue to work on


## Outcomes
we will go to scipy and SPY
