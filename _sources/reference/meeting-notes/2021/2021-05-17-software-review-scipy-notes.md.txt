## Notes
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->
1. software review sync

- devicely
  - ask on twitter about reviewers
  - OW: could act as reviewer, worked on related tool
- pymedphys
  - LW: pymedphys -- actually a set of tools -  similar to astropy
- some issues we should close  - close all of the old presumbissions

2. editorial board

- Lets start with Ivan, David and Leah
- We might consider domain "buckets"
- ROpenSci + JOSS like model
- who do we want, how long do they serve
- we have onboarded them

## Action Items

- LW: close older issues w/invitation to submit
- LW: will get back to simon about PyMedPhys
- DN: add suggestion to editor guide to update initial comment w/reviewers etc. so it's right at top of issue
- DN: post on twitter asking for reviewrs for devicely
- DN: figure out if there's overlap for phylup
- DN: follow up w/LW + IO about mentored sprints at SciPy

## SciPy Mentored Sprints (David) - Tania Allard

* they are doing these springs at pycon
  - <https://mentored-sprints.netlify.app/>
  - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUHyP8ki_Q>
- could we use pyOpenSci maintainers to participate in the mentored sprints?
  - Have them bring friends who can contribute to the sprints?
  - maintainers would need to identify things to fix
  - Then they would come to the sprint
  - Do they have to register for scipy?
  - sprints are run in discord
  - git help desk
  - maintainers volunteer time to
    - find issues ahead of time
    - work with people  who want to submit PRs
    - ask them to do things that aren't code contributions like run through a tutorial and raise issues, etc.
  - Open science labs - they do hae training materials already in (spanish?)

Challenges with mentored sprints
- getting envt setup
- knowing what issue to work on

## Outcomes

we will go to scipy and SPY
