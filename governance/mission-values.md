# Mission, Vision and Values

The mission of pyOpenSci is to support building a diverse community of practice around the free, open Python tools that drive open, reproducible scientific workflows.

We support our mission by:

* building community capacity to contribute to open software
* Creating community
* Open peer review
* Training and mentorship

## Why do we support open science?

Science is now data-driven. And as such, data science supports scientists
processing the data that they need to address critical questions.

We value open science workflows because they allow scientists to build upon each
other's work rather than recreating already developed workflows. Building on
top of existing workflows accelerates science as it prevents scientists from needing to rebuild existing workflows from the ground up.

## Why is (free) and open source so important?

Open source software refers to the tools scientists (and others) use to
process data. Free and open software is critical to science as it allows
scientists to access the tools they need to process their data freely.
If the tools are free and open, they lower barriers for others to use them
without paying costly subscription fees.

This free and open-source software is critical to supporting the development of
open scientific workflows
