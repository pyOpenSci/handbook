# Mission, Vision and Values

pyOpenSci's mission is:

> pyOpenSci broadens participation in scientific open source by breaking down social and technical barriers.

Who we are:

> We are a community of novice to expert Pythonistas; together, we make creating, finding, sharing, and contributing to reusable code more accessible to everyone everywhere, supporting open science and advancing discovery

To support our mission we:

* Build an inclusive community of practice

* Run [open software peer review of scientific software](https://www.pyopensci.org/about-peer-review/index.html) and offer [mentorship](https://www.pyopensci.org/#broadening-participation-in-scientific-open-source) for new reviewers and editors
* Develop accessible education resources and run training and sprint events

## Why open science?

Open science ensures that every part of the scientific workflow—including data, code, and methods—is openly available. This **promotes transparency**, fosters collaboration, and allows scientists to build upon each other's work. By sharing data and tools, open science **accelerates discovery** and makes research more reproducible.

## Why is free and open source software important?

A key part of open science is using **open source software**, which provides scientists with the tools to access, process, analyze, and visualize data. **Free software makes workflows reusable and ensures more equitable access.**

<i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i> **Open source software is essential for building fully reproducible scientific workflows.** By ensuring that research tools remain accessible to all, we support more transparent and inclusive scientific research.

## pyOpenSci values

Some of our core values include:

* pyOpenSci values supportive, diverse community members
* pyOpenSci values empowerment through training and mentorship
* pyOpenSci values collaboration with existing communities
* pyOpenSci values open reproducible science


Members of the pyOpenSci editorial team have diverse backgrounds. We welcome editors from academia, government, and industry. We especially welcome applications from prospective editors who will contribute to the diversity (ethnic, gender, disciplinary, and geographical) of our board. We also value having a range of junior and senior editors.
