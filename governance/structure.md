## Fiscal sponsorship

pyOpenSci is a fiscally sponsored project of [Community
Initiatives](https://www.communityin.org).

pyOpenSci does not have its own standalone non-profit status. Instead,
it inherits this status by being a fiscally sponsored project. This
means that it relies on its fiscal sponsor for major administrative and
legal services, including 501(c)(3) status and financial management.
