# Storing internal pyOpenSci documents

Google Drive, a part of the pyOpenSci Google Workspace plan, is where all pyOpenSci documents, spreadsheets, google slides, photos, and graphics are stored. These documents include, but are not limited to:

* branding guidelines
* event planning documents
* lesson development drafts and plans,
* slides that support talks and presentations
* and more.

As a pyOpenSci staff member, you should store any documents related to pyOpenSci in the **pyos-shared** Google Shared Drive. Storing documents in the **pyos-shared** drive ensures that all pyOpenSci employees can access, edit, and use these documents. Storing these documents in the shared drive also supports program task redundancy, as the document's owner is the organization in that drive rather than an individual user. Storing documents in a shared drive owned by the organization helps pyOpenSci staff jump in and help another staff person in the event of a needed but unplanned absence (e.g., a medical emergency or an unexpected family issue).

Employees can save personal documents such as 1-on-1 agendas and notes, personal notes, and other information that does not need to be shared at the organizational level in their personal drive.
