# New Hire Onboarding

pyOpenSci is a fiscally sponsored project. All hiring processes and staff classifications adhere to the policies and procedures established by our fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives (CI).

This page provides an overview of the onboarding steps and tools specific to pyOpenSci. For Human Resources (HR) and onboarding purposes, staff positions fall into two categories:

- **Benefits-eligible positions**
  - Roles of **21 or more hours per week**.
  - Eligible for benefits based on Community Initiatives (our Fiscal Sponsor) policies.

- **Flexible positions**
  - Roles with flexible hours, determined during hiring.
  - Not benefits-eligible.
  - May or may not receive a pyOpenSci email, depending on role needs (for example, public-facing vs internal work).

## Benefits-eligible positions (21+ hours per week)

## Email groups

pyOpenSci staff may be added to one or more email groups to support their role as needed:

- [admin@pyopensci.org](mailto:admin@pyopensci.org): used for administration tasks such as hiring calls.
- [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org): used for general social media work.

## Announcing a new hire to the community

Once a new employee joins pyOpenSci, it's time to let the community know!

- **Announce in Slack**: New staff will be introduced in the `#pyos-updates` Slack channel and invited to share a bit about themselves.
- **Add to website**: Update the [contributors.yml file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyopensci.github.io/blob/main/_data/contributors.yml) in our pyopensci.github.io, which will add them to the ["Our pyOpenSci" ](https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/index.html#executive-council-leadership--staff) community page.
- **Introductory blog post**: New hires write a brief blog post introducing themselves to the community. Topics may include work background, hobbies, why they joined pyOpenSci, and their role.
- **Social media**: Post the hire announcement on pyOpenSci social channels.


## Staff check-ins

When new members join the pyOpenSci team, a standard weekly check-in meeting is scheduled with their manager. These meetings provide an opportunity to:

- Discuss current tasks and progress.
- Ask questions or request guidance.
- Address challenges or propose workflow improvements.

Meeting cadence may be adjusted over time based on team needs. If bi-weekly meetings are more productive, we will shift to that cadence; otherwise, we will continue with weekly check-ins.
