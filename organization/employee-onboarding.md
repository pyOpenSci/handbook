# Employee & Contractor Onboarding

:::{admonition} about
:class: note

This page provides an overview of how we hire and engage with core staff, project-based staff, and contractors who we work with to further the pyOpenSci mission.
:::

pyOpenSci is a fiscally sponsored project. All hiring processes and staff classifications adhere to the policies and procedures established by our fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives (CI).

For onboarding purposes, pyOpenSci staff positions fall into two categories:

- **Benefits-eligible positions**
  - Roles comprised of **21 or more hours per week**.
  - Eligible for benefits based on Community Initiatives (our Fiscal Sponsor) policies.

- **Flexible, project-based positions**
  - Roles with flexible hours, determined during hiring.
  - Not benefits-eligible.
  - May or may not receive a pyOpenSci email, depending on role needs (for example, public-facing vs internal work).

## Benefits-eligible positions (21+ hours per week)

Before pyOpenSci onboarding begins, the new hire is guided through the onboarding process with Community Initiatives, which includes completing required paperwork and attending Human Resources training.

Once Community Initiatives onboarding is complete, all benefits-eligible pyOpenSci staff receive the following:

**Google Workspace account**
- A pyOpenSci email (`name@pyopensci.org`) will be created.

**Google Drive access**
- Added to `pyos-shared` and other relevant shared drives.

**pyOpenSci GitHub organization access**

As part of the onboarding process, New staff are given the freedom to choose their preferred GitHub account. Depending on their role and personal preference, they may opt to use their existing personal account or create a new one specifically for their work with pyOpenSci.

## Flexible project-based positions

At pyOpenSci, we value flexibility and autonomy. Our flexible roles offer the freedom to set your own schedules, are project-based, and are typically compensated based on the hours worked. This means you have the power to manage your work hours, with some overlap with the pyOpenSci core team.

Typically, project-based roles involve a time commitment of 5-20 hours on average, with the time commitment sometimes varying from week to week and month to month, depending on the available work.

Unless they are hired as an outside contractor, flexible employees complete onboarding with Community Initiatives and report time using Community Initiatives' Paylocity platform.

**Google Workspace account**
- We will create a Google Workspace account if there is a clear business need for the role (for example, external communications or another specific role).
- [Learn more about how we use GitHub.](google-workspace)

## Email groups

pyOpenSci staff may be added to one or more email groups to support their role as needed:

- [admin@pyopensci.org](mailto:admin@pyopensci.org): used for administration tasks such as hiring calls.
- [media@pyopensci.org](mailto:media@pyopensci.org): used for general social media work.

## Engaging with the community

Announcing a New Hire This section outlines the process of announcing a new hire to the pyOpenSci community, emphasizing the importance of community engagement and the role it plays in fostering a collaborative environment.

- **Announce in Slack**: New staff will be introduced in the `#pyos-updates` Slack channel and invited to share a bit about themselves.
- **Add to website**: Update the [contributors.yml file](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/pyopensci.github.io/blob/main/_data/contributors.yml) in our pyopensci.github.io, which will add them to the ["Our pyOpenSci" ](https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/index.html#executive-council-leadership--staff) community page.
- **Introductory blog post**: New hires write a brief blog post introducing themselves to the community. Topics may include work background, hobbies, why they joined pyOpenSci, and their role.
- **Social media**: Post the hire announcement on pyOpenSci social channels.

## New Hire evaluation and support

At pyOpenSci, we believe in ensuring a supportive transition for new team members. To foster this, we implement an evaluation process during the initial phase of employment.

Following the policies of our fiscal sponsor, Community Initiatives, all positions at pyOpenSci are at-will. We encourage an open dialogue about job experiences and expectations. New hires will undergo a six-month evaluation period. This includes a three-month check-in to discuss progress, challenges, and any support needed.

The three-month and final six-month check-ins also serve as an opportunity to assess whether the role and expectations are a good fit for both the team member and pyOpenSci. In some cases, if significant concerns remain regarding performance or alignment with organizational needs, employment may not continue.

Our intention is to create an environment where everyone feels supported and encouraged to thrive as part of the pyOpenSci team, while also ensuring that we maintain the effectiveness and cohesion of our small team.

## Staff check-ins

When new members join the pyOpenSci team, a standard weekly check-in meeting is scheduled with their manager.
:::

These meetings provide an opportunity to:

- Discuss current tasks and progress.
- Ask questions or request guidance.
- Address challenges or propose workflow improvements.

For project-based or contractor roles, meeting cadence and format may vary depending on the scope of work. The meeting cadence may also be adjusted over time based on the team's needs.
