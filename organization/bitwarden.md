# Bitwarden

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a password manager and passkey service. pyOpenSci uses Bitwarden at both an individual and account level.   

Individuals are encouraged to use Bitwarden to secure personal passwords related to their work at pyOpenSci, for example when using Google Workspaces services such as Drive and Gmail, as well as applications and platforms such as Slack and Canva.  

At the organizational level, Bitwarden is used for shared login access to a variety of accounts, such as Eventbrite and Buffer. This is done when only one organizational account is needed, and then accessed by pyOpenSci team members as needed.
